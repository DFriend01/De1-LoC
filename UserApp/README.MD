# To start the app follow the instructions on the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) website
Follow the Environment Setup Instructions. This project was developped on Windows for Android using the React Native CLI, so following the setup steps for those conditions is advised and no guarantees are issued that any other setup will work.
# Set the Config Files
If you are running on the emulator make sure EMULATOR is set to 1
If you are running the backend via ngrok, make sure you set NGROK to the approprite link, and change the
LOCALHOST value to 0.
# Running the App
Once setup you can run the app via the command `npx react-native run-android` whilst in the `UserApp/` directory.
